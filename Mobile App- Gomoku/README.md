# Mobile_App-Gomoku

This repository contains the source code for a Gomoku game developed for Android in Kotlin, as part of the Mobile Programming subject. 
The application features a graphical interface and utilizes the httpClient and GSON libraries to communicate with an HTTP API. 
It was developed in collaboration with my colleagues Pedro Silva and Catarina Pedro.
